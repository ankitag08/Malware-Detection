# Malware-Detection
Now a days as computers have become more ubiquitous and connected, security has become a major concern.  Malicious software, referred to as malware, is an ever-growing security threat and the detection of malware remains an important area for security. Security breaches are not rare topics in the news. Conventional security software requires a lot of human effort to identity threats, extract characteristics from the threats, and encode the characteristics into software to detect the threats.  
 
This tough process can be more efficient by applying machine learning algorithms. As a result, many researchers and analysts have investigated various machine learning algorithms to detect attacks more efficiently and reliably.  
 
The objective of the project is to apply different machine learning algorithms on multiple datasets to analyze them for detection of malware.
